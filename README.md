# BankSimulationAssignment
An older class project. Not the best code by any stretch of the imagination, but being a novice to computer science at the time, I was pretty happy with it. The program takes a file of customer sample data, such as time of entry and length spent with a teller (which unfortunately I don't have anymore), and command line arguments specifying the number of tellers and lines at a bank and if a drive-through lane is present. It then finds the best way to process all customers, with minimal idle times for tellers and minimal wait times for customers as the metric.
